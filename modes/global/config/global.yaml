# All persistent non-wizard configuration :
# - Multiball lock & advancement
# - Wizard mode progression
# - Pop bumpers awards
# - Start/stop handlers dor field mode and mission mode
# - Other ?
#   . Cross mission qualifier
#   . Qualifier for extra balls
#   . ...
#
# This is the general mode that underlies non-Wizard-mode gameplay, and handles
# progression tracking for global values like missions, drops, and multiball lights.
#
# This mode does NOT include lights, sounds, and shows for these progressions,
# since active mission modes may overrule them. Instead, those elements are part
# of the Field mode.
